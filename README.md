# Everything Movies (They're here!)

## Overview

### What does it do?
"They're here!" is a movie database app. Users can browse movie reviews, articles & statistics

### How it works...
Created using Python's Django framework, the MVC structure seperates logic and design, and provides url routing, 
making code easily accessible and tidy. The source code and SQL database are deployed to Heroku, users with adminstrative 
privelages may add/edit objects (i.e. magazines, movies) from django's built in admin panel.
